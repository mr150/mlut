The [mlut](https://github.com/mlutcss/mlut) core contains:
- Sass tools
- CSS library
- JIT engine

### Installation ###

```
npm i -D @mlut/core sass-embedded
```

When using this package, you will need to install Sass separately. We recommend [sass-embedded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-embedded), but regular [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) is also suitable.

This allows you to control the versions of all your dependencies, and to choose which Sass implementation to use.
